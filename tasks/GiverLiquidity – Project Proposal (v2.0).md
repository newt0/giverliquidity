## GiverLiquidity – Project Proposal (v2.0)

### 🔥 Problem Statement

At Web3 events, numerous swag items are distributed, yet they often become ephemeral souvenirs with no connection to meaningful community engagement or altruistic actions like donations. Despite being inherently aligned with Web3 values, donation behavior remains invisible and unrewarded.

→ **GiverLiquidity** introduces a new UX paradigm that encourages and records “giving” as an on-chain reputation signal.

---

### 🌍 Project Overview

**GiverLiquidity** is a decentralized application (dApp) that starts with swag distribution at Web3 events and transforms it into an opportunity for participants to donate and mint a reputation NFT.

- **Swag Recipients**: Choose to donate or express intent → Mint a Reputation NFT
- **Exhibitors**: Showcase donation records + reputation score
- **Outcome**: On-chain actions and reputations are linked, enabling trust to circulate

---

### 🎯 Tagline

> **Donate Swag. Mint Reputation.** > **Prove You're a Giver. Onchain.**

---

### 🧑‍🎤 Target Users

- **Participants**: Individuals receiving swag at events (airdrop hunters, newcomers)
- **Exhibitors/Sponsors**: Companies, DAOs, and projects
- **Organizers**: Event hosts, local governments

---

### 💡 Use Case Examples

#### CASE 1: ETHGlobal Tokyo

1. Participant receives a T-shirt at a booth
2. Scans QR code → Inputs donation amount in dApp → Mints a Reputation NFT
3. NFT is Soulbound (non-transferable) and can be displayed on profile

#### CASE 2: Municipality x Web3 Event (Sendai City)

- Local product coupons instead of physical swag
- Donations directed toward disaster recovery and tourism projects
- Reputation becomes a prerequisite for DAO participation

---

### 🔁 User Flow (Participant)

1. Scan QR code upon receiving swag
2. Enter donation amount on dApp (optional)
3. Choose to donate or express intent
4. Mint a Reputation NFT

### 🧠 Philosophy & Design Principles

- **Intent Logging**: Records will, not just transactions – valorizing sincerity
- **Anti-Fraud Mechanism**: Linked with SNS identity to discourage dishonesty
- **Reputation as On-chain Karma**: Foundation for social trust

---
