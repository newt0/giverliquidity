## **Title: Integrating Meta-Prediction Markets**

---

### **1. Overview**

GiverLiquidity introduces a **prediction market mechanism**, allowing users to make two separate choices:

- Whether they will **donate** their swag or **not**
- Whether they **believe most people will donate or not** at this event

This dual structure enables us to record both **individual action** and **social trust perception** as distinct layers of user behavior.

---

### **2. Detailed User Flow**

1. Receive swag at the event
2. Choose whether to donate or not
3. Predict whether **the majority of attendees will donate**
4. Stake USDC or similar tokens on the outcome
5. After the event, the actual donation rate is confirmed via on-chain data
6. Winnings are automatically distributed to those who predicted correctly

---

### **3. Positioning the User’s Inner Beliefs**

This system makes visible a user's **meta-cognitive stance** — not just what they do, but how they perceive society:

| Action       | Prediction | Interpreted Stance                                    |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Donate       | Majority   | Idealistic Giver (optimistic trust in humanity)       |
| Donate       | Minority   | Realist Giver (skeptical but principled)              |
| Don't Donate | Minority   | Rational Egoist (self-interest driven)                |
| Don't Donate | Majority   | Cynical Contrarian (disconnected belief vs. behavior) |

---

### **4. Implementation Notes**

- **Donation rate** is verified **on-chain** via swag donation transactions
- Prediction market uses **binary outcomes** (Yes/No) with USDC staking
- Smart contracts modeled after **Polymarket** or **Manifold** (lightweight structure)
- **Automated settlement** after the event with transparent payout logic

---

### **5. Message & UX Value**

- Encourages users to confront both their **moral decisions** and **trust in the collective**
- Redefines the **prediction market** as a tool for **social good**
- Evaluates not only generosity, but also **intellectual foresight**

---

### **6. Variations & Extended Use Cases**

- Create “**Trust Indexes**” for DAOs and Web3 communities
- Visualize donation rates through **graphs and heatmaps**
- Build **Trust Maps** across countries and chains for cultural insight

---

### **7. Conclusion**

By asking not only **“Will you donate?”** but also **“Do you believe others will donate?”**,
GiverLiquidity transcends basic altruism tracking and evolves into a **thought experiment DApp** —
one that visualizes **social reasoning and belief systems** on-chain.
