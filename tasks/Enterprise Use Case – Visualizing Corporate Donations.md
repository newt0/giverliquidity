# 📦 **GiverLiquidity: Enterprise Use Case – Visualizing Corporate Donations**

## ■ 1. Concept Overview

When companies exhibiting at events **donate surplus swag or designated items in bulk**, GiverLiquidity allows them to **record and prove these actions on-chain**, linked directly to their **official Twitter accounts**.

This creates a mechanism to **permanently verify corporate goodwill** on-chain—enabling its use in **CSR reporting** and **brand positioning**.

| Challenge (Current State)                                 | Solution (GiverLiquidity 2B)                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

| Web3 corporate activities are **qualitative-only**        | Quantify contributions → rankings, badges, and SBTs |
